Title: Windows Bluescreen and Boot Loops (update: caused by a Crowdstrike update)
Content Snippet: My workplace has a number of people reporting Windows blue-screening and going into a boot loop. The IT Department have a number of servers recently gone offline and have said there's a chance that the two issues are related, and potentially due to a Crowd Strike application update.
My laptop blue-screened and rebooted, but is working fine after the reboot.
A local radio station has also said they've got the same issues with their laptops and their phone system is down as a result.
Not seeing anything on news sites yet. Anyone else seeing similar?
Above is all based in Australia.

Title: Show HN: Sendune – open-source HTML email designer
Content Snippet: Demo: https://designer.sendune.com/
Code: https://github.com/SendWithSES/Drag-and-Drop-Email-Designer
HTML for email is probably the hardest code to write. Even a teeny-tiny deviation from the rules will break the email in untold combination of os/desktop/mobile clients.
It's mid 2024. Almost 50 years since email was invented and 35 years since HTML was born. A 'basic-open-source-HTML-email-designer' must be a solved problem, right? We thought so too.
Sadly, that's not the case.
There are a few decent open source email designers but they carry dependencies that make them cumbersome to embed within your app. That's why we decided to open source our HTML Email Designer.
The SENDUNE email designer focuses on simplicity and ease of use. It is light-weight. It does pure HTML - no intermediate code wranglers like mjml. There is no lock-in of any kind. Save HTML output as a template and use with ANY email service provider.
Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests.
